* compiler - Turns source code into machine code
* compile-time error - An error that occurs while you are compiling code
* cout - Prints something to the console. It is included in the <iostream> library
* executable - A computer program that can be run. It is the result of compiling source code.
* function - Made up of 4 parts: return value, name, parameters, and the body
* header - Allows you to bring in code from another file
* IDE - Intergrated Development Environment. Includes many resources that help you program, including a text editor, compiler, and linker
* #include - allows you to link other files
* library - a file that contains code which can be used in other programs
* linker - links all the files used into one file
* main() - A function that must be used in all c++ programs.
* object code - The result of running source code through a compiler

### Chapter 3
* assignment - Gives a variable a new value

* conversion - Converting from one type of literal to another
* declaration - A statement that gives a name to an object
* decrement - Decreasing the value of a number by 1 or more
* definition - A statement that introduces a new name and sets aside memory for a variable
* increment - Increasing a number by 1 or more
* initialization - Creates a empty variable
* name - The name of a variable
* narrowing - Converting from a type literal to a smaller type literal and losing some piece of information because of it
* object - A region in memory with a type that specifies what kind of value can be stored in it
* operation - Using an operator to get a value from some other values
* operator - Used to operate on other values (Ex: +,-,*,/,%)
* type - Specifies what kind of values can be stored in a variable
* type safety - It can be safe or unsafe to convert from one type to another depending on how much space that types can hold
* value - What is contained in a variable
* variable - Used to hold a value of different types

### Chapter 4
* computation - To take an input and produce an output
